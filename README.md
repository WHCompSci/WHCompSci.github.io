# Warren Hills High School Computer Science Website

- This is a website where students in Mr. Detrick's Honors Advanced Topics CS class can post projects (games, apps, etc.) that they have created.

- You can access it here: [whcompsci.github.io](https://whcompsci.github.io/).


- The main page is `index.html` and the projects are in the `projects` folder.

- The website uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- It is a client-side only website, so there is no server-side code.
